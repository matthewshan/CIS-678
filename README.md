### Project 1 - Flesch Index Calculator
> Authors: Justin Kaukonen and Matthew Shan

**Introduction**
At the beginning of this project, we initially focused on getting the Flesch Index for each text file. However, once we got this working, we decided to explore whether or not there was a relationship between Average Words per Sentence and Flesch Index and Average Syllables per Sentence and Flesch Index.

**Methods:**
For this project, we decided to use Python. Libraries we employed were MatPlotLib, numpy, and Scikit Learn. For graphing we used Matplotlib. For a simple linear regression model, we used the Scikit learn library.
