Hello, this is a test file to test the first project for our Machine Learning course
at Grand Valley State University. What it does is it calculates the number of sentences,
words, and syllables in a document, and does some math to determine the complexity of
it. The higher the number, the higher the complexity. Simple, right?
Supercalifragilistic expialidocious. We need to have some circumnavigation and discontinuity
to get some high syllable words in.
